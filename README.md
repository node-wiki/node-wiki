A Note on Changes

This wiki is being revamped and rewritten. However, we have kept the legacy
prototype's tags available on this repository for any reason that followers
of the legacy codebase may see fit. The last legacy version of this project
is available on the [version 0.0.1-prototype][0.0.1-prototype] branch.
